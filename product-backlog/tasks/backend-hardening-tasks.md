# Backend Answer-Engine — Hardening Tasks

Cross-cutting hardening for the Java answer-engine backend (`voice-support-bot/backend`,
contexts `knowledge` + `conversation`). These are **out of the Sprint 7 core theme**
(answer-engine happy path BE-004…BE-006) and scheduled opportunistically before the
pilot, unless pulled in earlier.

| Task | Title | Classification | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TASK-BE-012 | Backend REST error contract (`GlobalExceptionHandler` + `ErrorResponse`) | V1 hardening | TASK-BE-002 | Planned (out of Sprint 7 core theme) |

## TASK-BE-012 — Backend REST error contract

**Parent:** EPIC-005 (Answer engine) — cross-cutting API hardening
**Classification:** V1 hardening
**Status:** Planned (out of Sprint 7 core theme; opportunistic, before pilot)
**Priority:** Medium
**Branch:** `task/TASK-BE-012-backend-error-contract`
**Surfaced by:** TASK-BE-004 adversarial review (2026-07-18) — degraded-mode / privacy
finding.
**Relates to:** TASK-BE-009 (observability / correlation id), ADR-0010
(industrialization: contracts + observability), TASK-WEB-006 (the voice-runtime
equivalent — generic error responses, closes RF-013).

### Context

The backend currently has **no `@RestControllerAdvice`**. When a dependency is down
(Ollama embedding endpoint, Postgres/pgvector) or a request is malformed, the REST
endpoints (`/api/knowledge/sync`, `/api/knowledge/ingest`,
`/api/conversation/retrieve`) fall through to Spring's **default error handling** and
can return a 500 whose body may echo raw exception text (upstream URLs, driver
messages, stack hints).

This mirrors two problems already fixed elsewhere in the workspace:
- voice runtime **RF-013 / TASK-WEB-006** — stop echoing raw provider error text in
  `/stt` `/tty` `/turn` 502 bodies;
- dashboard `GlobalExceptionHandler` — return a generic `ERR_UPSTREAM` + correlation
  id, keep full detail server-side only.

### Objective

Introduce a shared, sanitized REST error contract in the backend:

- `@RestControllerAdvice GlobalExceptionHandler` returning a structured
  `ErrorResponse` (snake_case) with a stable `error_code`, a `correlation_id`, and a
  **generic** client message — never `ex.getMessage()` verbatim.
- Map the common cases:
  - bean-validation / malformed body → **400** (`ERR_400`);
  - upstream dependency failure (embedding / vector store unavailable or timing out)
    → **502/503** (`ERR_UPSTREAM`);
  - not found where relevant → **404**.
- Add request validation: `@NotBlank` on `RetrievalRequest.question`
  (`spring-boot-starter-validation` is already on the classpath) so a blank question
  returns a 400 instead of a silent `LOW_CONFIDENCE`.
- Log the full exception detail server-side with the correlation id (structured),
  nothing sensitive in the client body.

### Acceptance

- A malformed request (blank/missing `question`) returns `400` with an `ErrorResponse`
  (`error_code` + `correlation_id`), not a `LOW_CONFIDENCE` 200 and not a 500.
- A dependency-down request (embedding/vector store unavailable) returns a documented
  `502/503` `ErrorResponse` with a stable `error_code` + `correlation_id` and **no**
  internal detail (no upstream URL, no driver/stack text) in the body.
- The full error detail is available server-side in structured logs with the same
  `correlation_id`.
- Covered by `@WebMvcTest` (contract) + a focused test proving no raw exception text
  leaks into the response body.

### Notes

- Keep the domain/application layers free of transport concerns — the advice lives in
  `shared/web` (or `shared/web/rest`) so both contexts reuse it.
- Correlation-id propagation should align with TASK-BE-009 (OTel); if BE-009 lands
  first, reuse its correlation-id source instead of inventing a second one.
